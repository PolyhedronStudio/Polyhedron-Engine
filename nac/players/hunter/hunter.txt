Other info              : Lot of work went in to this little baby, lots of talent came together
			  to produce a quality product.  François-Xavier Delmotte has included a
 			  huntebase.pcx, which is a base skin for those wanting make err...more
 			  skins.  People should find it a very useful aid.  

Additional Credits to   : id software.  François-Xavier Delmotte and Deranged for creating
		  	  the most awesome skins I've seen in a while.  I can't stress enough how
 			  much a good skin enhances a model.  Thanks to Eric vonRothkirch for
			  supplying excellent, original sounds.  Larry Ellis for telling me what
			  sucked and what didn't suck :)

Bugs/comments/excuses   : Ho k, I was pretty darn happy with the final tris.  The main probs lie 
			  in that it doesn't conform to the bounding box too well on some anims.
			  So if your the kinda person who does flip-offs while looking directly 
			  at walls or taunts in very low ceiling rooms, then this aint the ppm 
			  for you.  However, if you spend 90% of your time running, shooting, 
			  jumping and dying then you should be ok :)  
			  I spent a lot of time getting limbs and proportions looking right.  So
 			  appreciate it dammit! Oh, and the poly count is definately to high for
 			  my liking.  Although it was well of 1200 with the original cut, so I
		  	  haven't done too bad.
			  

Build/Animation time    : few weeks, on an off.
