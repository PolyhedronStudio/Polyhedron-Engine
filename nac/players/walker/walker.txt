
Walker PPM - A Quake2 Plug-in Player Model by Roger [666] Bacon
________________________________________________________________


In Brief:
-----------------
o- Fully Animated, Low Poly Quake2 Player model
o- 3 Player skins [Firestorm, Scout666, Rorshach]
o- New Mechanoid sound effects


Authors Blurb: :)
-----------------
Well this is my first foray into the wooly world of 3D character modelling and animation 
- The Walker PPM is a small mech which looks pretty like the ED-209 mech off Robocop, the Marauder mech off Battletech/Mechwarrior, and anything else with 'chicken' style reversed legs and twin cannons (even the AT-ST Scout Walker off Star Wars!).. i'm sure you get the idea :)
I wanted to create a low poly model for use when I'm playing the eraser bots... My pc is already slow and when you get PPM's with 800+ faces it tends to chug a bit..

As some of you know I have been churning out many free Quake2 skins from my website, content with skinning the id models and a few custom PPM's.  Well one long weekend I decided to try and create my OWN player model, and here it is!


Installation
-----------------
Unzip the file into your Quake2 directory (make sure you unzip with the '-d' option if you are using PKunzip instead of Winzip)
If anything goes wrong (naaah!) make sure all the .pcx's, .md2's, and .wavs are in this directory:
	Quake2/Baseq2/Players/Walker/

Now in-game if you go to the Multi-player setup menu you will be able to change your model to Walker, and your skin to any of the 3 provided.


Tools Used:
-----------------
Modelled in 3DSMAXr2, animated in Quake Model Editor[qME] (dont ask!!)
Skinned in the Almighty Photoshop 4, with help from Npherno's skin tool.
Sample sounds provided by my mate Gordon at Rage Software, chopped to buggery by me in Goldwave :)


Eternal Gratitude to:
----------------------
Gordon at Rage for the sounds
Smirnoff, maker of fine Vodka
Evan Dorkin for making me unwillingly laugh like a hyena...


Shameless Plugs:
-----------------

This is my first ever Quake model so send me lots of mail of what you think about it (good/bad/ugly.. hopefully good :))
If you want to get into creating your own models, I would ask somebody else as i'm new to this myself!
